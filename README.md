# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan is designed to ensure that all aspects of the instruction of AP Computer Science Principles at Golden Valley High School have been explored and planned for. In turn, the plan will help the teacher support their students to success.

## Context

### AP Computer Science Principles

The course provides an overview of computer science. Students will:
* Learn to design solutions to problems and evaluate the efficacy of those solutions
* Develop algorithms and programs which include abstraction
* Discover new knowledge using data
* Explain how computing systems and innovations work and explore the potential impacts of those innovations
* Collaborate in a computing culture ethically

### Golden Valley High School

Golden Valley High School is one of six comprehensive high schools in the Merced Union High School District. Located in the central San Joaquin Valley, the district serves approximately 10,500 students from the Merced, Atwater, and Livingston communities. There are 13 feeder school districts for the entire high school district. Golden Valley's approximately 1,850 students come from schools in seven of those feeder districts.

MUHSD has invested in providing chromebooks to each student. Each campus is outfitted with wireless access points in each classroom and most of the common areas. Students are able to access their Google apps and the internet while at school, in any class or common area they may be in. Unfortunately, there are a number of students who do not have internet access at home; there is a lack of availability for people who live away from the city and some families cannot afford its cost. Students often find ways to still complete their work, often by utilizing a free period or lunch time on campus.

One of MUHSD's LCAP goals is to make all students college and career ready. Every student is required to take a minimum of two years of courses that are focused on career and technical skills (CTE). Ideally, every student will gain proficency or certification in the CTE industry sector they choose to follow. AP Computer Science Principles is considered a "capstone" course in the Information & Communication Technology sector. Students typically enter the class in their junior or senior year.

### Application

In an effort to help ensure that teachers will meet the auditing requirements of the course, the College Board has endorsed curricula for AP Computer Science Principles. These preapproved curricula have been developed by organizations that are expert in computer science and education, from Apple and Microsoft to Code.org or Tynker. Golden Valley has chosen to adopt the AP Computer Science Principles curriculm available on CodeHS. Per the College Board website:

> "With a unique focus on creative problem-solving and real-world applications, the CodeHS AP Computer Science Principles curriculum gives students the opportunity to explore important topics of computing. Students use their own ideas and creativity, build artifacts of personal value, and develop an interest in computer science that will foster further endeavors in the field." (College Board, n.d.)

The CodeHS curriculum uses a blended classroom approach of mixing both online activities with in-class collaborative activities. Students code directly in the CodeHS editor, which is accessed online via the student's workstation computer (in class) or their chromebook (out of class). The course is designed to help students gain programming experience early in the year and then use their computational thinking practices to explore the remaining course topics. Lessons in each unit contain video tutorials, example coding to explore and analyze, written programming exercises, free response exercises, and short quizzes. There are also collaborative projects (pair programming) and research projects. 

In planning for the course, the instructor must be aware that not all students will have reliable internet access at home. Homework and other out-of-class activities should be tasks that may be done without an active internet connection. This may be work to complete using paper and pencil, but can also be a Google document that the students download onto their Chromebook for offline editing.

#### Homework/Out-of-Class Activities

**Free Response Exercises**
* Students practice their writing skills while answering a variety of prompts, both reflective and expository.

**Coding Exercises**
* Students can plan pseudocode for a program to meet a specific goal. They can then use their code during class time to write the program. Alternately, students can analyze given coding language to determine the output or to look for errors in the code.

#### In-Class Activities

**Daily Warm-Up via Google Jamboard or Google Form (Peer Instruction)**
* A question with discrete options is posed.
* Students consider and submit their answers individually.
* Students discuss their answers with their partner, outlining the reasoning behind their response.
* Students are given a chance to resubmit or change their answer.
* The correct answer is reviewed, with students sharing their (or their partner's) reasoning with the entire class.

Peer instruction "explicitly incorporates opportunities for students to explain their reasoning and engage in argumentation, practices that help students integrate new information with existing knowledge and revise their mental models" (Knight & Brame, 2018). It also allows for immediate feedback, allowing students to reflect on their misunderstanding and monitor their own understanding (Knight & Brame, 2018). The warm-up question can be framed to review the previous day's lesson or to spiral review from prior concepts. Questions that uncover common student misconceptions are particularly beneficial to helping students discover why that idea is incorrect (Knight & Brame, 2018). This is also a good format for helping students practice debugging a provided program.

**Video Tutorials (Curated by CodeHS or AP Classroom)**
* Students will complete guided notes while watching these short videos.

All students will benefit from completing guided notes. The blanks "serve as strong prompts and scaffolding to direct students' attention to the lecture, as well as to the content of their notes" (Chen et al., 2016). Additionally, the videos are available to students on-demand, allowing students to access them as needed for review or clarification. 

**Check for Understanding (Short Quizzes on CodeHS)**
* After completing their guided notes, students will complete a short "quiz."

The instructor can use the results of the checks for understanding to guide a class discussion to address any misconceptions the students may have. In addition, the following day's warm up can be used to reinforce these ideas and help students solidify their reasoning. 

**Examples & Coding Exercises**
* An example of specific types of coding are provided each lesson.
* The instructor and students will discuss the example before students complete coding exercises, within CodeHS.
* As students work, the instructor can use class time to address students 1-on-1 to discuss their work, give help, etc.

**Collaborative Programming Exercises (Pair Programming)**  
* Students work with their partner to complete a coding challenge. This includes time to:
  * Brainstorm and discuss
  * Plan, including writing pseudocode
  * Code to meet the goals of the challenge, including code reviews
  * Reflect on the entire procress

One student is the driver, who actively works on the design. The second student is the navigator, who observes the driver's work "to ensure objectivity, logic and process flexibility" (Kavitha & Ahmed, 2015). This practice "promotes not only quality programming skills, but also enhances responsibility, mentoring, teamwork and increased sense of passion" (Kavitha & Ahmed, 2015). The pair should actively be working together to meet the goals of the challenge. Indeed, the "effectiveness of the pair programming depends on effective and frequent brainstorming among the pair" (Kavitha & Ahmed, 2015). The roles should also be switched so both students gain experience in both roles.

**End of Unit Assessment**
* Students will take a summative multiple-choice unit quiz at the end of each unit, in the style of May's AP test.

**AP Create Performance Task**
* Students will spend a minimum of 12 hours of class time to create an authentic, "real-world" product that includes:
  * Complete program code
  * Video that displays the program running and its functionality
  * Written responses to prompts provided by the College Board

### Impacts

Technology has become such an integral part of daily life. High school students are on their phones constantly, participating in multiple conversations on Snapchat, checking social media, playing games and more. They are connected to and see the world in a way that is much different than previous generations.

MUHSD went one-to-one nearly a decade ago, realizing that students needed to become much more familiar with using computers and the internet. Many professional developments were offered to teachers to help them integrate technology into their lessons. For example, notes can be posted for students who were absent. Tutorial videos can be posted for students who need extra help. Teachers can organize the entire unit (or course) online in Canvas (or on a website) for students to access on-demand. The Google Translate extension can help English Learners access digital materials in their home language. Assignments can be modified to meet the requirements of an IEP, without calling undue attention to the student. There are so many tools and applications available online that can help all students learn and access the content for any class they are taking.

At the same time, instructors need to ensure that they are still using good teaching strategies. Classes need to engage students at higher Depths of Knowledge. Lessons should be student-centered, with students actively engaging in partner and class discussions. Explicitly teaching expectations and holding students accountable for their learning is key to their continued success. Having those structures in place can also help the class pivot and still use class time productively if the technology fails on a given day (for instance, if the internet goes down in a wing of school due to workers accidentally cutting the fiber optic cables). 

Courses, like AP Computer Science Principles, help students begin to explore the impact of technology on society. Often, students don't even realize that what they are doing may be questionable or even illegal, especially regarding the use of copyrighted images. Students should begin to contemplate the ethics of cheating, the social impacts of one's digital footprint, or even privacy concerns in the face of the increasing presence of technology and data mining in daily life. While there are no easy answers, students will be better prepared to use technology as they continue toward adulthood.

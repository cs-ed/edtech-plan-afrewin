# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan is designed to ensure that all aspects of the instruction of AP Computer Science Principles at Golden Valley High School have been explored and planned for. In turn, the plan will help the teacher support their students to success as they begin exploring computer science and how it relates to other fields.

## Context

### AP Computer Science Principles

AP Computer Science Principles provides an overview of computer science. Students will:
* Learn to design solutions to problems and evaluate the efficacy of those solutions
* Develop algorithms and programs which include abstraction
* Discover new knowledge using data
* Explain how computing systems and innovations work and explore the potential impacts of those innovations
* Collaborate in a computing culture ethically

The District has invested in providing chromebooks to each students. Each campus is outfitted with wireless access points in each classroom and most of the common areas. Students are able to access their Google apps and the internet while at school, in any class they may be in. Unfortunately, there are a number of students who do not have access at home, due to lack of availability for people who live away from the city or a family's inability to afford the cost.    

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

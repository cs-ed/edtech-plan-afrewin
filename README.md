# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan is designed to ensure that all aspects of my instruction of AP Computer Science Principles at my high school have been explored and planned for. In turn, the plan will help the teacher support their students to success as they begin exploring computer science and how it relates to other fields.

## Context

### AP Computer Science Principles

AP Computer Science Principles provides an overview of computer science. Students will:

* Learn to design solutions to problems and evaluate the efficacy of those solutions
* Develop algorithms and programs which include abstraction
* Discover new knowledge using data
* Explain how computing systems and innovations work and explore the potential impacts of those innovations
* Collaborate in a computing culture ethically

### Golden Valley High School

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
